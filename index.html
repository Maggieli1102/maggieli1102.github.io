Hello! My name is Xinyi Li. I'm a Chinese student studying at Mizzou. My name is hard to pronounce so you can also call me Maggie. I'm a senior IT student. I really like digital media, so I chose this one as my IT elective course. I'm really interested in media technology so I learnt many softwares like Adobe photoshop, premiere, after effect, indesign by school and myself. This is my first 100% regular online course, I hope I can get used to it and learn more knowledge from this experience. Looking forward to share and study with professor and everyone:)
